# Demo Project using NextJs with App Router, Typescript, Chakra UI and Apollo client to query a GraphQL API.

### Install

To initiate the project:

- Clone via github
- Npm Install to install dependencies
- Npm run dev to start in localhost

## Rick & Morty public GraphQL API

The project fetchs and displays the locations in one page and shows more information of a particular location following NextJs conventions of ../[id].

The list of locations can only be seen if the user is logged in. Login details get saved via local storage and shared with the rest of the app using React UseContext.
